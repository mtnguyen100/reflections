1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	- It creates a new repository to store my commits to files
	- Allows me to see my history and metadata of these files

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	- It allows you to see what files you are going to commit with
	- It is different from the working directory and repostory in that it shows files in both the working directory and the repository
